## Installation
clone the repo from the git hub account listed in this readme, and run npm i to install the dependencies.

### Setting up the sample database
got into the local repo at the root level.  
run `source db/db.sql  
run `source db/schema.sql  
run `source db/seeds.sql  
  
## Usage
From a terminal window, type index.js and you'll be greeted with a menu of choices.  Select the appropriate choice and follow the prompts.  

NOTE:  CURRENTLY THE FUNCTIONALITY IS FAILING.  When you select something from the menu, the query returns data but then the application just hangs up.  So you have to restart the application after every selection.

to start the application 
Node Index.js
after a query runs, click ctrl-c and restart the application and select your next query.
